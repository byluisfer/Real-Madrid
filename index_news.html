          Real Madrid Blow Away Title Rivals Girona With Thumping 4-0 Victory
        </h1>
        <h1 class="gol-news-little-subtitle">
          The LALIGA title race could be all done and dusted with 14 games still
          to be played after Real Madrid crushed their closest rivals, Girona.
        </h1>
        <img

        />
        <p class="gol-news-little-text">
          The home side ran out 4-0 winners in the biggest win recorded by any
          league leader against the second-ranked team in the competition on
          home turf since Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5-0 way back in 1945.
          <br /><br />
          Girona had been LALIGA’s surprise package this season, coming into
          this game only two points behind Real Madrid and having only been
          beaten once all season, against their rivals at Estadi Montilivi in a
          3-0 defeat in September. <br /><br />
          The visitors had the odds stacked against them for their latest
          encounter, with coach Míchel given a touchline ban after being sent
          off for his protests against a refereeing decision against Real
          Sociedad last weekend. In addition, influential midfielder Yangel
          Herrera and experienced defender Daley Blind were both absent through
          suspensions of their own after collecting five yellow cards.

        </h1>
        <h1 class="brahim-news-little-subtitle">
          Brahim Díaz scored a sensational goal on Tuesday to earn an
          injury-plagued Real Madrid a 1-0 win and the advantage in its
          Champions League last-16 tie against RB Leipzig.

        <p class="brahim-news-little-text">
          The 24-year-old’s brilliant effort was the only goal of the first leg,
          with the Spanish giant taking its slim lead into the return fixture at
          the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid on March 6. <br /><br />
          After the host had kept the 14-time European champion at bay in the
          first half, Díaz broke the deadlock in the 48th minute. The diminutive
          attacker picked the ball up on the right touchline, before beating his
          defender with a deft body-feint. <br /><br />
          He then dribbled past two more Leipzig players, staying on his feet
          despite attempts to knock him off balance.

          Revealed: Why Jude Bellingham could receive TEN-game ban
        </h1>
        <h1 class="bellingham-news-little-subtitle">
          Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham could reportedly face a
          10-match ban for allegedly calling Getafe loanee Mason Greenwood a
          "rapist".

          alt="bellingham-image"
        />
        <p class="bellingham-news-little-text">
          The two England youngsters clashed during Madrid's 2-0 win at Getafe
          on February 1, with Bellingham allegedly mouthing the word "rapist"
          towards the Manchester United loanee. After Getafe lodged a complaint
          with La Liga's representative and a lip reader looked into the
          incident, The Sun writes that the league has referred this to the
          Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF). <br /><br />
          The report adds the RFEF are appointing a judge to fully investigate
          the incident and they will decide within the next two weeks whether
          the 20-year-old will be punished. If found guilty and it falls under
          the 'serious' category, the former Borussia Dortmund star could get a
          four-match ban but if considered 'grave', Bellingham may be suspended
          for 10 games. Both Madrid and Getafe would have 10 days to appeal that
          verdict.

          Real Madrid continue to dominate La Liga salary limits
        </h1>
        <h1 class="salary-news-little-subtitle">
          Real Madrid have consolidated their position as the richest and most
          financially healthy club in Spain, with a salary limit of €727m.
        </h1>
        <img

          alt="salary-image"
        />
        <p class="salary-news-little-text">
          Real Madrid’s salary limit is more than double that of their closest
          rival, Atletico Madrid, who can spend €303m. Barcelona, meanwhile, who
          have been struggling with a financial crisis for the past few years,
          have seen their salary limit drop from €270m to €204m. <br /><br />
          La Liga’s salary limits are designed to ensure the financial
          sustainability and competitiveness of the clubs, as well as to comply
          with the UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules. As Javier Tebas explained a
          couple weeks ago publicly to Fabrizio Romano, Real Madrid are in such
          a great financial position, that signing Kylian Mbappe (and “another”)
          is no problem at all.

          One of the Real Madrid veterans plans to extend his contract with the
          club
        </h1>
        <h1 class="kross-news-little-subtitle">
          Given that Carlo Ancelotti's contract with Real Madrid has already
          been extended until 2026, the likelihood of Toni Kroos remaining for
          another year has increased.
        </h1>
        <img
          src="images_News/kross_news.png"
          class="kross-news-little-image"
          alt="kross-image"
        />
        <p class="kross-news-little-text">
          The Italian tactician highly esteems the German for his strategic
          prowess in the midfield and advocates for his extension, particularly
          considering the diminishing significance of his midfield counterpart,
          Luka Modric, at the club, as reported by the German publication Sport
          Bild. <br /><br />
          Despite the emergence of younger talents such as Eduardo Camavinga and
          Aurelien Tchouameni, Kroos remains a pivotal figure in Real's
          midfield, as he continues to impress consistently in decisive matches
          for "Los Blancos". His recent performances have convinced Madrid's
          management of his outstanding qualities, and negotiations for the
          extension of his contract are expected to commence at the end of
          March, with both parties keen on reaching an agreement.

          The new role that Luka Modric would ful fill at Real Madrid
        </h1>
        <h1 class="modric-news-little-subtitle">
          The Croatian is approaching the end of his career and would occupy an
          important place in the Madrid structure.
        </h1>
        <img

          alt="modric-image"
        />
        <p class="modric-news-little-text">
          He is on his way to putting an end to a successful career, but at 38
          years old he has him as a substitute at Real Madrid. The Croatian has
          won everything with the club with which he has a contract until June
          2024 and which has not offered him an extension. <br /><br />
          Given this situation, The Athletic assures that Carlo Ancelotti
          offered Modric to become part of his technical staff at Madrid in case
          the multi-time champion decided to retire at the end of this season.
          <br /><br />
          However, the former Tottenham footballer sees himself as having the
          strength to continue playing, even if it is not for Real Madrid and
          that is why he would have said 'no' to Ancelotti, but not outright
          because there are several months left until the end of the
          relationship.
